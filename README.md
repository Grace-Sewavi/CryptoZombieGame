#  CryptoZombies Lessons in Solidity

Welcome to my learning journey through the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io) game — a fun and interactive way to learn **Solidity** (the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts).

This repository contains my code and progress from each lesson of the CryptoZombies course. I'm documenting everything as I go to track my growth as a blockchain developer. 💻

##  About CryptoZombies

CryptoZombies is a free, open-source, gamified course that teaches you how to build games on the blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts. It's designed for complete beginners and covers:

- Solidity Basics
- Smart Contract Inheritance
- Events & Web3.js
- Security Best Practices
- Building a Full Dapp Game
